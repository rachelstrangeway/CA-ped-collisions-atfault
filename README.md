# Pedestrian-Involved Traffic Collisions: Who's at Fault?

## Assessing the rate of pedestrian-involved collisions and the at-fault party in the city of Los Angeles from 2012-2021.

This liability share is determined in an insurance claim by a few different factors, including party and witness interviews, photo evidence, and any on-file police or individual report, which must include a Primary Collision Factor and cited party at fault. The implications for who is cited as at fault on the police report are many – it can determine if the collision will appear on your driver record, can cause insurance rates to increase, may be used as evidence in a personal injury lawsuit, and as mentioned can be factored into an insurance adjuster’s liability determination.
